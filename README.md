# Introduction

This current project involves creating a look-alike of a typical google homepage. I expect to demonstrate the typical skills involved in such an effort. This is a important first step. 

## Summary

This was a first official project and focus was mainly spent on improving capabilities as it relates to flexbox while trying to keep up with challenges faced in satisfying most mobile devices. Deployment using git was also understood during this project. Although, an initial error prevented early completion of the project, it was sufficiently summounted to create a fairly compliant replica. This is the <a href="https://joshuaogri.github.io/google-homepage/">live demo</a>.
